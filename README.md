Tools to help manipulate and plot supernova data from the ATLAS telescopes

The code herein is in a perpetual state of development and is intended to help people who eyeball the supernova data from ATLAS (whether you're at QUB or not). Supporting code will gradually be added. Right now, the code needs to be retrofitted for other users to engage with it.
